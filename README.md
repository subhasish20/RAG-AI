# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI with LangChain 🤖📺

Welcome to the * RAG**! This project leverages **LangChain**, **YouTube Transcript API**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create an intelligent chatbot that answers questions based on the content of YouTube videos. The integration of **YouTube data** and **RAG** enables precise, context-aware answers directly from video transcripts.

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-time Q\&A**: Ask questions based on the content of YouTube videos 🎥❓
* **LangChain-powered**: Uses LangChain to manage workflows, chain together data retrieval, and generate responses 🔗💬
* **YouTube Transcript API**: Extracts accurate video transcripts to ensure relevant answers from YouTube videos 📝🎬
* **RAG Model**: Combines retrieval and generation for precise, real-time answers 🤖💡
* **Scalable & Modular**: Easily extendable to integrate additional data sources, models, or functionalities 🌱

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the following libraries:

* **LangChain**: For managing retrieval and generation pipelines
* **YouTube Transcript API**: For fetching video transcripts
* **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search
* **Hugging Face**: For working with transformer-based models like GPT


### 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches video data (including metadata and transcript) using the **YouTube Transcript API** and processes it into useful formats. 📹
2. **Embedding & Indexing**: The transcript is processed into **embeddings** using a language model, and stored in **FAISS** for fast retrieval. 🔍
3. **Answer Generation**: When the user asks a question, the system uses **LangChain** to retrieve relevant video segments from the transcript and generate a response using a pre-trained language model like GPT. 💬
4. **Chat Interface**: A simple CLI or web interface allows users to interact with the chatbot and ask video-related questions. 🗨️

## 💡 Example Use Case

1. **User**: "What does the video 'The Science of Climate Change' explain about global warming?"
2. **Chatbot**: *Retrieves relevant segments of the video transcript and generates a response:*
   "The video explains how human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are major contributors to global warming, causing climate change impacts worldwide."
